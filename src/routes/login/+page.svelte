    Access to features such as joining or creating communities
    on this site requires you to login to the NOSTR netowork

</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://getalby.com/">Alby</a></li>
    <li>
        <a
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nos2x/kpgefcfmnafjgpblomihpgmejjdanjjp"

    Unlike a traditional web platform this site does not store
    any data on its own servers but instead interacts with
    relays on the NOSTR network
</p>
<p>NOSTR is a protocol that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allows you to own your own online identity.</li>
    <li>
        Allows you to cryptographically sign all your
        interactions on the network to prove you are the author.
    </li>
    <li>
        Enable an open source, censorship resistant, freedom
        oriented network of participants to interact with each
        other freely online.
    </li>
    <li>
        Carry your identity and social graph across various
        different apps that leverage the protocol.
    </li>
</ul>
