# NOSTR Meetup Communities
Meetup events on Nostr using Sveltekit and [NDK](https://github.com/nostr-dev-kit/ndk)

Users can create Communities, similar to how you would on meetup dot com, and then attach [NIP-52 Time based Calendar events to them](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/52.md)


You can see the NIP here https://github.com/BrightonBTC/nips/blob/master/73.md (at time of writing there's an open pull request to get this implemented)
